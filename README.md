# DCAM_demo
Demo code for a clustering-based aggregation model (DCAM).

DCAM_demo.py demonstrates details of the corresponding DCAM paper.
This code is implemented by TensorFlow.

Because the datasets are a little large, we do not upload them to Github.
And the code is not executable currently.

You can ask me for data if you are interested in our work.
